# PRINCE
A Python 3 reference implementation of the lightweight block cipher PRINCE and an example of several integral attacks on round reduced version of PRINCE.

The implementation works on the test vectors provided by the authors of the cipher. It is a straightforward, unoptimized implementation.
No effort has been made to defend against side-channel or any other kind of attacks.
